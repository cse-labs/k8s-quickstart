## Best practices for presentations

- It is helpful to partner with someone to present a topic.

  - Share your screen and ask if it is readable.
  - Set your font size before you start the presentation.
  - For widescreen monitors, adjust your resolution for others that don't have a wide screen.
- Double check that mic is working and people can hear you.
- Tips during the presentation.
  - "quiet mouse" - only move your mouse and scroll your screen when necessary.
  - Scroll slowly.
  - Close unused windows and tabs.

  - Plan your close and close quickly. Make it clear that the session is over.
