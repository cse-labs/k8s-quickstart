# Docker Walk Through

> 100 level

## Docker Introduction

- Intro to Docker: <https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/architecture/microservices/container-docker-introduction/>

### Some basic docker commands

```bash

# show local images
docker images

# pull an image
docker pull ubuntu
docker images

# let's run the image interactively as a "jump box"
docker run -it --name jbox ubuntu

# notice your prompt changed to something like this: root@257fde9a1ad2:/#
# we are now "in" the docker container

pwd
cd root

ping bing.com

# oops - ping isn't installed
# let's install ping, curl and some other goodies
apt update
apt install -y --no-install-recommends iputils-ping curl redis-tools mariadb-client httpie

# ping works
ping -c 1 bing.com

# http works
http https://www.bing.com

exit

```

### We don't want to have to do that every time

```bash

# save our changes to a new image
docker commit jbox jumpbox
docker images

# let's run our new image
docker run -it --name jbox jumpbox

# oops
docker ps -a

# we have to remove the instance first
docker rm jbox
docker run -it --name jbox jumpbox

# your prompt changes again
# we're in the root directory (/) and we want to start in the home directory (~)
exit

# tell docker where to start
docker commit -c "WORKDIR /root" jbox jumpbox

# remove the instance and run again
docker rm jbox
docker run -it --name jbox jumpbox

# from the docker container

pwd

exit

# See what's there
docker ps

docker ps -a

# there's a MUCH better way! We'll get there soon.

```

### Run a simple web app in Docker

```bash

# run a simple web app
docker run -d -p 80:8080 --name web retaildevcrew/goweb

# see what happened
docker ps
docker logs web

# send a request to the web server
http localhost

# recheck the logs
docker logs web

# run some commands in the container
docker exec web ls -al
docker exec web cat logs/app.log

# start an interactive shell in the container
docker exec -it web sh

# notice your prompt changed

# run a couple of commands and exit
ls -al
cat logs/app.log

exit

```

### Remove the web container

```bash

docker rm web

# oops - the container is still running, so we need to stop it first
docker stop web

# we can restart it
docker start web
http localhost
docker logs web

# stop and remove
docker stop web
docker rm web

# you could do this instead
docker rm -f web

# only jbox should show
docker ps -a

```

## Build a container

> At the end of the first section, we said there was a better way to build images ...

### Build a docker container

- goweb is a simple web app written in Go
  - don't worry if you don't know anything about Go
    - you don't need to - the beauty of Dockerfiles!

```bash

cd goweb

docker build . -t web

# look at what happened
docker images

# notice the size difference in the web container and the <none> container

# let's see what we told Docker to do
# notice these commands are very similar to the first section
code Dockerfile

```

### Run the container

```bash

docker run -d --name web -p 80:8080 web

# verify it's running
docker ps

# send a web request and look at logs
http localhost
docker logs web

```

### Stop and remove the web container

```bash

docker rm -f web

# only the jumpbox should show
docker ps -a

```

### Let's run MariaDB in a container

```bash

# start the server
# use -e to specify an environment variable
docker run -d --name maria -e MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=SuperSecretPassword mariadb

docker ps

# start a client
# --link creates a link to the server container
# --rm removes the container when it exits
# sh -c ... runs the mysql CLI with the right parameters
docker run -it --link maria:svr --rm jumpbox sh -c 'exec mysql -h svr -uroot -pSuperSecretPassword'

# from the MariaDB prompt
# MariaDB [(none)]>
show databases;
exit;

docker ps -a

# notice the MySQL client container is gone (--rm)

```

### Let's run something a little more complex

```bash

# run a Redis container
docker run -d --name redis redis

# restart the jbox container
docker start -ai jbox

ping redis

# oops
# We have to attach the containers to the same network
exit

# create the network
docker network create vote

# add the containers to the network
docker network connect vote maria
docker network connect vote redis
docker network connect vote jbox

# let's try again
docker start -ai jbox

ping -c 1 redis
ping -c 1 maria
ping -c 1 jbox

# let's connect to Redis
redis-cli -h redis

set Dogs 100
set Cats 3

# exit redis-cli
exit

# Run the mysql CLI
mysql -h maria -uroot -pSuperSecretPassword

show databases;
exit;

# exit the jumpbox
exit

# let's run a web app that talks to the redis cache
# notice we attach it to the network
docker run -d --net vote --name govote retaildevcrew/govote

docker start -ai jbox

http govote:8080

# Dogs RULE!

# exit the jump box
exit

```

### What if we want to access the website from our codespace

```bash

docker rm -f govote

# Same run command with -p option to expose the port
docker run -d --net vote --name govote -p 8080:8080 retaildevcrew/govote

http localhost:8080

# our network still works
docker start -ai jbox

http govote:8080

exit

# We can also access remotely from codespaces
# Click on "PORTS" tab in the terminal
# Click on Open in Browser (globe icon) in the 127.0.0.1:8080 port

# Dogs RULE!

```

### Container size matters

Notice the size difference in the diferent images - from 13 MB to 9.87 GB

The size of the image has a big impact on deployment time, so you want to minimize your image size. That typically also reduces your security footprint.

```bash

docker images

```

### Cleanup

```bash

docker rm -f govote
docker rm -f redis
docker rm -f maria
docker rm jbox

# remove unused images / networks
docker system prune -f

# check results
docker ps -a

```
