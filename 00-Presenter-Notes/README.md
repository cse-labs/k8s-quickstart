# Information for Presenters

This document has two goals.

1. Help people manage their session from idea to presentation.
2. Collect best practices for presentations.

## Types of Presentations

These are some ideas for the types of sessions you can choose from here. You can also choose a different style that is a better fit for your content.

- Hands-On sessions
  - Presenter provides instructions in a repo where audience can follow along
- Demo + Q&A
  - Showcase a feature or topic. At the end, take questions about the content.
- In-Depth presentations
  - Presenter expands on a specific topic. Providing in-depth details about the topic.

## Logistics for the Session Preparation

- Pick a session idea, or add one to the [project board](https://github.com/retaildevcrews/k8s-quickstart/projects/1)
- Assign the presenters to the issue.
- Work with your team during sprints to schedule.
- Create calendar invite and invite team members.
  - Usual times are Tuesdays and Thursdays from 3:30 PM to 4:30 PM Central. But this is flexible.
- Create a [retro link here](https://rdc-retro.azurewebsites.net/) for people to give feedback about your session.
- After session, upload video to Stream.

## How to Upload Videos to Stream

- "[Uploading Videos to Stream](https://msit.microsoftstream.com/video/92e5a3ff-0400-85a8-becc-f1eb87532a60)" video in the [Stream channel](https://aka.ms/rdc-demos).

Steps:

- Open recording in Stream.
- Update video details.
- Enable "Allow everyone in your company to view this video" if video is not team confidential.
- Shared with appropriate "RDC-*" channel. Choose "Channels", then search for "rdc".
- Make RDC group an owner. Choose "My groups", then search for "rdc" again.
- Enable the "Owner" option for the RDC group.
- Click "Apply".

## Peparing Content

- It is helpful to partner with someone to present a topic.
- Have 2 or 3 key learnings for the audience to take away from the session.
- Some topics benefit from learning with the end in mind. Give the audience an ideal end state, then work towards it in the presentation.
- Make a note of long running steps that can be executed before the live presentation. Include this list of steps in the invitation.
  - How to open repository with Codespaces
  - Logging into Azure and setting a subscription

## Before Starting the Presentation Call

- Adjust your resolution. Sharing widescreens sucks for those that don’t have wide screens – pretty unreadable
- Set your font to a readable size
- Color blindness is common – choose a color scheme that is inclusive
- Close unused windows / tabs to avoid “alt-tab hell”

## Before Starting Recording

- Mic check
- Share your screen and ask if it’s readable

## During Presentation

- “Quiet Mouse” – only move your mouse / scroll your screen when necessary (not as a nervous tick)
- Scroll  __s__ __l__ __o__ __w__ __l__ __y__  and avoid over-scrolling and having to scroll back up
- Double check that mic is working and people can hear you.

## End of presentation

- Plan your close and close quickly – “No more questions? Thanks for attending – recording is here. Bye.”
