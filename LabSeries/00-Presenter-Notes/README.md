# Notes for Presentation Recordings

## While preparing content

* Make a note of long running steps that can be executed before the live presentation. Include this list of steps in the invitation.
  * How to open repository with Codespaces
  * Logging into Azure and setting a subscription

## Before starting presentation call

* Adjust your resolution. Sharing widescreens sucks for those that don’t have wide screens – pretty unreadable
* Set your font to a readable size
* Color blindness is common – choose a color scheme that is inclusive
* Close unused windows / tabs to avoid “alt-tab hell”

## Before starting recording

* Mic check
* Share your screen and ask if it’s readable

## During presentation

* “Quiet Mouse” – only move your mouse / scroll your screen when necessary (not as a nervous tick)
* Scroll  __s__ __l__ __o__ __w__ __l__ __y__  and avoid over-scrolling and having to scroll back up

## End of presentation

* Plan your close and close quickly – “No more questions? Thanks for attending – recording is here. Bye.”
